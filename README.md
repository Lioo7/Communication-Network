# Communication-Network-Final-Project
The project is divided into 3 parts:<br>
* Part 1 - A server side and client side Python program which keeps track of sent messages and returns statistical information about how many were sent and how much was lost.<br>
* Part 2 - A server side and client side C program, using IPv4 & IPv6 protocols.<br>
* Part 3 - A computer communication system that is written in CPP, which allows direct communication between computers, and broadcast messaging, which effectively helps send a message indirectly by finding the shortest route.
